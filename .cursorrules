# Cursor Project Rules for VoiceDictate (macOS App)

1. **Build the app using Xcode or xcodebuild:**
   - Use `xcodebuild -scheme VoiceDictate -configuration Debug` (or Release) to build the .app bundle.
   - Alternatively, open the project in Xcode and build from the GUI.

2. **Run the app as a GUI application:**
   - Do NOT run the app as a CLI tool (e.g., with `swift run` or by executing the binary directly).
   - Instead, run the app using the `.app` bundle, either:
     - From Finder (double-click the .app), or
     - From the terminal with: `open path/to/VoiceDictate.app`

3. **Do not treat this as a command-line tool:**
   - The app uses AppKit and @NSApplicationMain, so it must be run as a macOS GUI app.
   - Running the binary directly will result in a crash (Abort trap: 6) because the required app bundle context is missing.

4. **Debugging:**
   - Use Console.app or Xcode's debug console to view logs.
   - If you need to see logs from the app, run it from Xcode or use `log stream` in Terminal.

# Summary
Always build as a macOS app bundle and run with `open` or via the GUI. Never run as a CLI tool.
